Our project, Anti-VPN, is based on building user profiles that can be used to identify a specific user even if they change some of their information. These profile’s can be used to identify users who are trying to get around a ban. For example, on the social media site reddit if a user gets banned for breaking the rules that user would no longer be able to create post or comment on other post. Although, it takes less than a minute to create a new account allowing the banned person to create or comment on post. This application, Anti-VPN, will be able to create a user profile of known IP addresses, devices, unique actions, and associated accounts. These profiles can then be used to identify banned users who are trying to get around the ban with a VPN or alternate account. 

Building this application will be tough and time consuming, but the curriculum here at the University of Cincinnati has helped to prepare me for this challenge. We started of the curriculum with an introduction to programming course, CS 1021C, that exposed us to a programming language, C++.  It is important for us to have a strong base in programming to take on the task of creating an original application. Then we had a Data Structures course, CS 2028C, which will be useful in creating the user profile objects along with more experience in programming. The next course that is applicable to this project is Software Engineering, EECE 3093C, which will help us create design documents for this application such as use cases. Currently, I am taking an Intelligent Data Analysis, CS 5152, course which will help in analyzing the data of the user profiles. Combining the skills of these course will help in creating this application. 

During my coop I worked at College Source Inc which is a software development company focused on creating academic software for scheduling classes and other related applications. While I was on the coop I had extensive interactions with four large web applications and re-wrote a reporting area that focused on displaying student data to advisors. Efficiently displaying student data will help in creating and displaying user profile data. While I was at College Source I was working as a full stack developer. This is important because we will need to set up databases to store the data and experience with SQL and other backend language will help. Also, the front end languages will help because we will to set up front end scripts to record and send back user data. 

Exploring and finding patterns has always been an interest of mine. This will be present in the project because we will need to use data analysis to see if two accounts are the same person. This application will also be a chance to explore the fields of data analysis and data mining from a practical prescriptive. Further researching these topics and which open source technologies are available to help us build user profiles is an interest as well. Our preliminary approach is to research which technologies are out there that we can use to collect the user data. Take the Reddit example from above we might be able to pick a sub section of the social media site to analyze. In this section we could have a web scrapper collect a user’s profile data and send it back. Once we have the user data we could set up a profile with the user’s IP, username, unique phrases, unique post, associated accounts, ban status, and if they use a VPN. 

After the user profile is created we would need to set up some data sets with known associated accounts to train a model on. After we create the model we could use it to analyze if two users are the same person. The expected results for this project are to research and implement a web scrapper, build user profiles, and a data analysis model that is best for the comparison of two user profiles. We can evaluate contributions by if the team member is attending the weekly meetings, and at least attempting their piece of the project. There will be a view milestones for this project the first is collecting the data with a web scrapper. The second milestone is building the user profile, and third is building a data analysis model.
