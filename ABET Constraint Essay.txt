Homework #7- ABET Constraint Essay - Due 10/30
You are to submit one 4 paragraph essay per project. Your essay should address 4 topical areas that may constrain the possible solutions for your project. Each paragraph should be at least 6 sentences and address one of the following specific topical areas.
* Economic
* Professional
* Ethical
* Legal
* Security
* Social
* Environmental
* Diversity and Cultural Impact
The main questions to keep in mind in your essay is this: Does this topical area factor into your solution and impact the kinds of solutions that are viable for your project (and if so, how)?
* Economic: are there financial limitations to the solution? For example, are you relying onfreeware or shareware, or do you have a budget for actual purchases? Are your funds supplied personally or by a company? Are you restricted to UC or other facilities? Will your solution contribute to economic development?
* Professional: does your project have a direct or indirect impact on your professional development or public reputation? Does your project need and apply specialized expertise?
* Ethical: does your project have a direct or indirect moral impact on someone? If so, what concerns or precautions are being considered to insure that this impact is positive (or neutral) and not negative?
* Legal: Are there legal issues or constraints associated with your project? For example, will you be using intellectual property that may be in dispute?
* Security: Are there security concerns with your project? Are potential viruses or eavesdropping an issue? Are there privacy concerns?
* Social: will your project be used for public service? Will it be used by a non-profit agency? Does it have some benefit for society? Does it enhance people’s lives or quality of life in some way?
* Environmental: are there limitations about where and how the project will be used or deployed? Are there concerns about environmental impacts such as pollution or other potentially harmful side effects? Will the project impact environmental conditions? Will the project reduce environmental impact of currently existing solutions?
* Diversity and Cultural: Are there any cultural constraints, such as language, lifestyle, or local customs that will impact your solution? How does promoting diversity and diverse use play a role in the design of your project?

Outline


Ethical
   * Concerns for user privacy
   * Example: Facebook's controversial shadow profile system
   * Can the data we collect be used to identify someone in a way that’s too personal?
Security
   * Logistics of ensuring the data we collect stays secured
   * Encrypt everything over HTTPS, avoid injection attacks, etc.
   * If we make use of any real-world data to test out our application, be sure that we use it responsibly
Diversity & Cultural
   * Speaking style flags may pose challenges with groups that speak many different languages
   * The challenge of having all-encompassing ML training sets (maybe?)
Legal
   * GDPR compliance
   * COPPA compliance

Our project will have issues with security that we must address. Since it will be used to collect the data of many different users, it is important that this data is secured from malicious actors. We need to ensure that data is sent through secured, encrypted channels. We must be sure to avoid the usual vulnerabilities such as SQL injection. The data that we store should not compromise users’ privacy. For instance, we wouldn’t want to store a user’s private chat messages unencrypted. Also, there is a chance that when we test out this system, we’ll borrow some real world user data. It is important that we handle this data carefully, being sure to not compromise anyone’s privacy by looking at something we shouldn’t look at or letting the data get leaked. This could be accomplished by asking the third party to omit password hashes from the data they give us, or even just have them not give us read access at all. We could give them our system, and then they could report their results to us.


Along with security concerns there are ethical concerns with our project. One of the major aspects of our project is using real world data. If a malicious user was to get past our security they could potential use the data to find out information about a person's location, daily patterns, phone numbers, emails, or some other information a person would want to keep private. This information could be used to hack a person's account or machine as well as finding them in the real world. Since there is potential for harm to happen to a person we as the programmers have an ethical responsibility to minimize the risk to the people whose data we use. This can be done by taking security concerns into account during the programming of this application, and to be careful about what data we collect and to think about how each new piece of data could potential harm someone. Another measure that should be taken is to make sure a person knows what data is being collecting, and that they have the right to delete there collected information at anytime. 


Diversity and culture will affect our project significantly. Since real world data is being used in our project we may encounter users from different countries, and regions. As we mine out patterns and unique behavior from the data we will encounter different languages, different slang, and different customs. For example if we have data from people from New York and people from Los Angeles these users will have different slang and key words from the areas. These variances occur due to the distance between the two areas limiting there interactions and splitting there cultural similarities. These cultural divide only increases as we include different countries and different languages in our real world data. 


There are several legal guidelines that our project will have to follow. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation requires disclosure of what data will be collected, as well as allowing users to request copies or deletion of the stored data. To satisfy these requirements, users will be required to agree to a license agreement that clearly states what data will be collected, as well as information about data requests. Any data requests received will be fulfilled by either an administrator or automated system. In addition, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act requires certain rules for the collection of use of data of children under the age of 13. To comply with these regulations, any implementations of the software aimed at children will have details of what data will be collected from young users listed in the license agreement. In addition, a parent’s verifiable consent will be required in order for users under 13 to use the service. Once the data collected from children is no longer needed, such as after a set time period or when an account is deleted, the unneeded data will be deleted.
