# Milestones

*Finish designing the core project architecture* - the base engine of the data analysis needs to be completed first. Afterwards, specific functionality can be plugged into it.

*Each flag/use case* - different flags are their own ambitious projects, depending on what they are.

*Implement the service in an actual application* - it is important that our project is useful for applications, so we need to test it on one to verify that our system works in practice.

# Timeline

## Zak

1. Use gRPC to create an interfacing library in Python to communicate between the analysis server and clients. *January 2019*
2. Develop the core of the analysis server in Python. *January - March 2019*

## Mitchell

1. Help develop the core of the analysis server in Python. *January 2019*
2. Code detection of account sharing. *February 2019*
3. Test the application with real-world data and verify that it works. *March 2019*

## Brendan

1. Help develop the core of the analysis server in Python. *January 2019*
2. Code detection of mass duplicate accounts. *February 2019*
3. Code detection of ban evasion. *February 2019*
4. Create a flag for text content. *March 2019*
