## Background description
The object of this project is to build profiles on people and detect rule breaking behavior such as avoiding bans or sharing accounts. These profiles will include their IP addresses, topics discussed online, unique words or phrases from user, known associates or friends, behavior, and unique actions or routines.
## Problem statement

Determining identity on the Internet is difficult. With VPNs on the rise, it's trivial for users to circumvent bans. 

## Inadequacy of current solutions

The industry defaults to banning all VPNâ€™s, but this can prohibit valid user from accessing content. Or an application can ban an IP, but with a VPN a user can access the application by changing there IP. 

## Background skills
We have all had coop's and networking classes along with a strong base in programming and computer science. Some of us had experience managing game servers, others are taking a data analysis courses or have experience from coops in data analysis. 

## Approach
Using Python as the programming language we intended to create an application which will interface with other applications a like on a game server or a web application or a forum/ social network. It well then collect and store data about users and try to create a user profile that will be able to identify the user from their actions and detect when they are breaking the rules.
