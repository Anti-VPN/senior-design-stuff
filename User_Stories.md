As a developer, I want an easy-to-use, extensible, and capable user analysis program so that I can easily deal with the problem of users who abuse my system.

As an admin, I want a simple interface to visualize user trends so I can see where problems are and take action accordingly.

As a product owner, I want a solution that deals with abusive users so that my product is as good, useful, and free of problems as possible.
