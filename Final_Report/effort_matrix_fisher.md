## Justification
While working on this project, I focused on a combination of project planning, documentation, research, and implementation. I collaborated on the design of the project, determining the scope of what we wanted to implement and the technologies we wanted to use. I did research on various methods of analyzing our data, and decided on ones that best suited our needs. I then designed a system that used these methods to get us the results we wanted.
